;;; Commentary:
;; Enforce a sneaky Garbage Collection strategy to minimize GC interference with
;; the activity.
;; During normal use a high GC threshold is set.
;; When idling GC is immediately triggered and a low threshold is set.
;; A more detailed explanation of the rationale behind this can be found at
;; http://akrl.sdf.org/

(defcustom gcmh-low-cons-threshold 800000
  "Low cons GC threshold.
This is the GC threshold used while while idling. Default value
is the same of `gc-cons-threshold' default."
  :group 'gcmh

(defcustom gcmh-high-cons-threshold #x40000000
  "High cons GC threshold.
This should be set to a value that makes GC unlikely but does not
cause OS paging."
